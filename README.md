# Bank Marketing Campaign Classification

## Description

This GitHub repository contains a comprehensive project for training and evaluating a classification model on the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset pertains to a Portuguese banking institution's direct marketing campaigns and aims to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [Bank Marketing dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing) obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It includes various features related to client information, campaign details, and economic indicators. The primary target is binary: whether a client subscribed to a term deposit ('yes' or 'no').

## Project Highlights
- Data Preprocessing: Data cleaning, feature engineering, and handling missing values.
- Exploratory Data Analysis: Analyzing data distributions and relationships between variables.
- Model Training: Implementing and training classification algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and more.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluating model performance using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrices.
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing model performance by fine-tuning hyperparameters.
- Cross-Validation: Employing cross-validation techniques to ensure robust model assessment.
- Model Deployment: A simple example of how to deploy a trained model for predictions.
- Jupyter Notebooks: Providing detailed Jupyter notebooks for each stage of the project, making it easy to follow along and reproduce results.
